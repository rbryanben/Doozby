Android video streaming application to demonstrate Cloud Winterstore as a storage service.

# Cloud Winterstore
<a href="https://github.com/rbryanben/cloud-winterstore">Cloud Winterstore</a> is a cloud storage service that provides object storage through a web service interface. It is basically S3 buckets with my own modifications. Instead of securing files using pre-signed URLs, a client can set access control measures for a file upon upload, thereby getting rid of the whole concept of buckets. For a person to view a file they will have to be either authenticated as the owner of the file, owner of the project or the key to that file exists in the current authenticated userâ€™s key set. All users having individual accounts.
